# Epilepsy-Seizure-Detection

Developed an automated EEG signal classification system to detect epilepsy with and without seizures. Implemented and evaluated ML and DL models like Random Forest (97%), 2D CNN(99%) and ResNet18 (98%) for accurate and real-time seizure detection.

# Objective

To design a robust seizure detection system that accurately classifies EEG signals using machine learning and deep learning models, enabling future real-time implementation in embedded systems.

# Dataset

EEG data collected from three categories:
- Normal individuals
- Individuals with epilepsy (no seizure)
- Individuals with epilepsy (with seizure)
